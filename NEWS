Version 1.0.2-br-inflow:

* A branch for inflow/outflow boundary conditions. This work starts out as a feature request by 
  Norm Sleep, who like to model plume-lithosphere interaction as the model in:

  Moore, W. B., G. Schubert, and P. Tackley (1998) Three-dimensional
  simulations of plume-lithosphere interaction at the Hawaiian swell,
  Science, 279, 1008-1011.

  Shijie then provides a patch from his old work:

  Zhong, S.J. and A. B. Watts (2002) Constraints on the dynamics of mantle
  plumes from uplift of Hawaiian islands, EPSL, 203, 105-116.

  The patch is quite specific to the model and is hard to integrate into the
  main trunk. So the patch will reside in this branch only. The branch most
  likely will not receive further development.

* Cleaned up Viscosity_structures.c by Shijie Zhong


Version 1.0.2

* Fix a bug in kinematic velocity boundary conditions in spherical geometry.
  If kinematic boundary condition is used in spherical geometry, CitcomCU
  may impose incorrect velocity as the boundary conditions and gives 
  incorrect results. The error is only significant near the poles though.
  See Issue 59 in the bug tracker (http://geodynamics.org/roundup) for more
  detail.

* Fixed an off-by-one bug. This bug doesn't affect the results of CitcomCU. 
  See Issue 58 in the bug tracker (http://geodynamics.org/roundup) for more
  detail.


Version 1.0.1

* A few minor fixes for the function and variable declarations.


Version 1.0.0

* Initial public release.
