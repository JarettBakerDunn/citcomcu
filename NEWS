Version 1.0.2

* Fix a bug in kinematic velocity boundary conditions in spherical geometry.
  If kinematic boundary condition is used in spherical geometry, CitcomCU
  may impose incorrect velocity as the boundary conditions and gives 
  incorrect results. The error is only significant near the poles though.
  See Issue 59 in the bug tracker (http://geodynamics.org/roundup) for more
  detail.

* Fixed an off-by-one bug. This bug doesn't affect the results of CitcomCU. 
  See Issue 58 in the bug tracker (http://geodynamics.org/roundup) for more
  detail.


Version 1.0.1

* A few minor fixes for the function and variable declarations.


Version 1.0.0

* Initial public release.
