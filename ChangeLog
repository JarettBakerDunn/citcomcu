	* src/plume-input, src/plume.jpg: Add sample input file of the
	  plume problem and image of the results

2007-05-25 20:24  tan2

	* src/Convection.c: Set up the inflow/outflow profiles

2007-05-25 20:21  tan2

	* src/Citcom.c: Disable maxT check, since the plume temperature can
	  exceed 1.5

2007-05-25 19:50  tan2

	* src/Boundary_conditions.c: The botm bcs should be imposed on the
	  3rd dimension

2007-05-23 23:11  tan2

	* src/prototypes.h: Forgot to update the prototypes

2007-05-23 23:10  tan2

	* src/Boundary_conditions.c: Added two functions for inflow/outflow
	  temperature and velocity BC for side (currently x-direction)
	  boundary

2007-05-23 20:53  tan2

	* src/Boundary_conditions.c, src/prototypes.h: Added a function for
	  user-defined tbc. Right now, this function adds a circular, high
	  temperature region for the plume source

2007-05-23 20:30  tan2

	* src/Boundary_conditions.c: Added flags for "flow-through"
	  boundary conditions for the top and bottom boundaries.
	  
	  When topvbc or botvbc is set to 2, the vertical vbc is dVz/dz=0,
	  the horizontal vbc is dVh/dh=const.
	  
	  When topvbc or botvbc is set to 3, the vertical vbc is dVz/dz=0,
	  the horizontal
	  vbc is Vh=const.

2007-05-23 20:18  tan2

	* src/Boundary_conditions.c: Changed the order of statements

2007-05-23 18:27  tan2

	* .: A branch for inflow/outflow boundary conditions.
	  
	  This work starts out as a feature request by Norm Sleep, who like
	  to model
	  plume-lithosphere interaction as the model in:
	  
	  Moore, W. B., G. Schubert, and P. Tackley (1998)
	  Three-dimensional
	  simulations of plume-lithosphere interaction at the Hawaiian
	  swell,
	  Science, 279, 1008-1011.
	  
	  Shijie then provides a patch from his old work:
	  
	  Zhong, S.J. and A. B. Watts (2002) Constraints on the dynamics of
	  mantle
	  plumes from uplift of Hawaiian islands, EPSL, 203, 105-116.
	  
	  The patch is quite specific to the model and is hard to integrate
	  into the
	  main trunk. So the patch will reside in this branch only. The
	  branch most
	  likely will not receive further development.

	  (break statements after return)

2005-12-19 18:16  luis

	  array declared with wrong size.
	  Should be: int nodes[5]

2005-12-16 22:47  luis

	* ChangeLog: Adding ChangeLog file.

	* src/global_defs.h: Provided instructions for regenerating
	  function prototypes.

2005-12-16 03:02  luis

	* src/prototypes.h: Somehow, cproto promotes float to double and
	  char to int by default.
	  Disabled such promotion with -p flag, and regenerated
	  prototypes.h
	  with the correct function prototypes.

2005-12-15 23:01  luis

	* src/Advection_diffusion.c, src/Instructions.c, src/global_defs.h,
	  src/prototypes.h: Added function prototypes to new file
	  prototypes.h, and modified
	  global_defs.h to include it. Two bugs were exposed by this.
	  First, eliminated an extraneous argument to the function calls
	  to temperatures_conform_bcs() in the Advection_diffusion.c
	  source.
	  Second, changed the signature of the signal handler in
	  Instructions.c
	  from (void)(interuption(void)) to (void)(interruption(int)).

2005-12-15 03:00  luis

	* src/Drive_solvers.c: In general_stokes_solver(), the variable
